### Heavy Iron###
# Planning-Based Visualization of Static Network Attack Analysis #

#About Heavy Iron #

The Heavy Iron project has two primary goals related to the representation and visualization of static attack analyses

+ An increased generative capability that extends current work on attack graphs to model attack context at a high level of granularity and provides interactive modification of network configuration to explore what-if reasoning

+ An increased visualization capability that exploits the expressive representation to render 3D visualizations of individual attacks across a range of user-defined topological and physical configurations  ![Project Logo](/_assets/images/heavyiron.png)
