*About CIRCUS*

The CIRCUS project worked to develop new cognitively informed plan-based models of narrative action and to demonstrate that these models can be used both to control a virtual environment and to make effective predictions about the results of usersâ€™ mental models of the stories that they characterize. Motivated by psychological models of plans and plan reasoning, the project built on  prior work in plan generation and plan-related communication to develop an architecture for creating understandable interaction in narrative-oriented virtual environments.
