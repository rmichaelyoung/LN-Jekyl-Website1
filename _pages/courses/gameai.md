# Game AI #

Michael will teach this course for the first time in the Spring
of 2018.  The course will be loosely based on the Game AI courses
developed by Shane Smit in EAE and David Roberts at NC State.  I plan
on covering a range of real-time and offline algorithms for the
creation of NPC behavior in game worlds.

The syllabus for this course is currently under development.
