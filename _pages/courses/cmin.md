# CS6964 Computational Models of Interactive Narrative #

_TL:DR: This course is about the real science behind intelligent story
creation and experience management systems like those that operate in
HBO's Westworld and Star Trek's Holodeck.  Check it._

In this course we examine the use of intelligent systems to control interaction within games and virtual worlds, focusing on the computational modeling of narrative as a primary organizing principle for that interaction. Class format is a combination of seminar and lecture, drawing from texts at the intersections of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, multi-agent systems, computational linguistics, user interface design, narrative and cinematography.

The course is taught by Dr. R. Michael Young.
