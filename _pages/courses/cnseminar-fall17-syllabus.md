# Course Summary #


Objectives: To increase participants' familiarity with recent and
important research results in computational narrative; to improve
participants' skills in presenting computational narrative research;
to provide a focused connection between existing narrative artifacts
and analytic and/or generative models of narrative.

Prerequisites: An undergraduate computer science background is helpful
for this course, but not strictly  required.  The readings are often formal and
computational at their core, despite their focus on narrative.  As a
result, students that aren't prepared for formal discussions to be a
part of their vocabularly will have a harder time with the material
and little or no background on the formal methods will be provided.

Students without an undergraduate degree in CS or a closely related
field should review the readings prior to enrolling to get a sense for
their level of preparation.

##Grading Policy##

Credit: A student may enroll in the seminar for either one or two credit hours.

Grading: Grading is based on participation. “Participation” is not merely presence; it means engaging with the course in ways that demonstrate sincere effort to master the course material. The primary course activities are:

reading the selected papers,
writing short summaries of the papers,
participating in discussions during seminar meetings, and
facilitating seminar meetings.
On every week that the seminar is held, every student taking the course for credit must read all of the papers for that week, submit a short summary of each paper prior to class, and participate in the discussion. In addition, every enrolled student must facilitate at least one seminar meeting during the semester.

Paper summaries should be submitted to the instructor, prior to class, via the seminar's Canvas web site. Late paper summaries are not generally accepted. Late paper summaries may be accepted in exceptional circumstances only, at the sole discretion of the instructor.

##Cheating Policy##

Cheating: In this course, “cheating” refers to plagiarism in the written summaries that students submit to the instructor. Cheating in this course is not tolerated. The penalty for cheating in this course is a failing grade for the course.

A summary must consist of a student's sole, original work. Unattributed copying of material from the papers being discussed or other sources is plagiarism as will be treated as such. Unacceptable paraphrasing of papers or other sources is also plagiarism and will be treated as such.
Students are encouraged to discuss the seminar's readings with each other—discussing the papers is a primary activity of this course! However, any written summary that a student submits to the instructor must be the original work of that student alone. Jointly authored summaries are not allowed.

All questions about the definitions of cheating and plagiarism in this course should be directed to the instructor. (The web has many resources that can help you to understand and avoid plagiarism, but if you have questions, please contact the instructor.)

Statement and Acknowledgment: In accordance with the School of Computing's Policy Statement on Academic Misconduct dated January 10, 2012, the instructor will discuss the School's academic misconduct policy in the first two weeks of the course. Students will be required to understand the policy and to submit an acknowledgment form. Links to the policy statement and acknowledgment form are found below.
