# CSxxxx Computational Narrative Seminar: Fall 2017 -- AI Models of Belief, Desire and Intention in Narrative:  The Battle of Scarif #

The Computational Narrative Seminar course meets weekly to
discuss foundational and/or recent and important 
results in the area of computational narrative research. For a typical 
meeting, attendees will read and discuss one paper chosen from

+ foundational or "classic" papers
+ recent computational narrative-focused journal articles, conference or
workshop papers
+ relevant non-computational papers, book chapters, etc, on narrative structure

Papers are selected for discussion according to the semester's focus
topic,
the papers' relevance to participants' own research, and/or the
papers' relevance to upcoming
Utah visitors. Some meetings may be centered on presentations of a
participant's own
research: e.g., a practice talk for an upcoming conference. Each meeting has one or more designated “facilitators” who are responsible for leading the discussion.  


The course is taught by Corrinne Lewis and
[R. Michael Young](http://lidauinarrative.cs.utah.edu/rmy/).

## Approximate and Tentative Syllabus for CS xxxx — Computational Narrative Seminar, Fall 2017

_This is a draft syllabus for the course for Fall 2017.  The official
syllabus will be available for enrolled students via Canvas._



**Objectives:** To increase participants' familiarity with important research results in computational narrative; to improve
participants' skills in presenting computational narrative research;
to provide a focused connection between existing narrative artifacts
and analytic and/or generative models of narrative.

**Prerequisites:** An undergraduate computer science background is helpful
for this course, but not required.  The readings are often formal and
at their core, computational, despite their focus on narrative.  As a
result, students that aren't prepared for formal discussions to be a
part of their vocabularly will have a harder time with the material.

### Grading Policy

Credit: A student may enroll in the seminar for either one or two credit hours!

Grading: Grading is based on participation. “Participation” is not merely presence; it means engaging with the course in ways that demonstrate sincere effort to master the course material. The primary course activities are:

+ reading the selected papers,
+ writing short summaries of the papers,
+ participating in discussions during seminar meetings, and
+ facilitating seminar meetings.
+ On every week that the seminar is held, every student taking the course for credit must read all of the papers for that week, submit a short summary of each paper prior to class, and participate in the discussion. In addition, every enrolled student must facilitate at least one seminar meeting during the semester.

Paper summaries should be submitted to the instructor, prior to class, via the seminar's Canvas web site. Late paper summaries are not generally accepted. Late paper summaries may be accepted in exceptional circumstances only, at the sole discretion of the instructor.

Just a note on expectations about participation.  The class meets just
once a week for one hour.  Your grade is based on participation that
is demonstrated primarily through class meetings, and the value of
your participation is shared and impacts all the other students.
Missing a class is a significant hit on your participation.  You can
miss class if you're sick or if you have another university-approved
reason for absence.  But missing a class because of unexcused reasons
will
impact your grade.  Examples of unexcused reasons for missing a class
include, but are not limited to:

+ Missing a class because you were in a research meeting and couldn't
get to class on time
+ Missing a class because you had a project due in another class and needed the hour's
time from our class to finish the work
