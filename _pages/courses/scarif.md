# CSxxxx Computational Narrative Seminar: Fall 2017 -- AI Models of Belief, Desire and Intention in Narrative:  The
  Battle of Scarif #

_TL:DR: This course is about the real science behind intelligent story
creation and experience management systems like those that operate in
HBO's Westworld and Star Trek's Holodeck.  Check it._

In this course we examine the use of intelligent systems to control interaction within games and virtual worlds, focusing on the computational modeling of narrative as a primary organizing principle for that interaction. Class format is a combination of seminar and lecture, drawing from texts at the intersections of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, multi-agent systems, computational linguistics, user interface design, narrative and cinematography.

The course is taught by Dr. R. Michael Young.

Course Summary

Description: The Computer Systems Seminar is a weekly meeting in which participants discuss recent and important results in the area of computer systems research. For a typical meeting, attendees will read and discuss one paper chosen from a recent systems, networking, or security conference. Papers are selected for discussion according to the semester's focus topic, the papers' relevance to participants' own research, and/or the papers' relevance to upcoming Utah visitors. Some meetings may be centered on presentations of a participant's own research: e.g., a practice talk for an upcoming conference. Each meeting has one or more designated “facilitators” who are responsible for leading the discussion.

Objectives: To increase participants' familiarity with recent and important research results in computer systems; to improve participants' skills in presenting computer systems research.

Prerequisites: An undergraduate computer science background is required for this course. General knowledge of computer systems design, both software and hardware, is necessary.

Grading Policy

Credit: A student may enroll in the seminar for one (1) credit hour.

Grading: Grading is based on participation. “Participation” is not merely presence; it means engaging with the course in ways that demonstrate sincere effort to master the course material. The primary course activities are:

reading the selected papers,
writing short summaries of the papers,
participating in discussions during seminar meetings, and
facilitating seminar meetings.
On every week that the seminar is held, every student taking the course for credit must read all of the papers for that week, submit a short summary of each paper prior to class, and participate in the discussion. In addition, every enrolled student must facilitate at least one seminar meeting during the semester.

Paper summaries should be submitted to the instructor, prior to class, via the seminar's Canvas web site. Late paper summaries are not generally accepted. Late paper summaries may be accepted in exceptional circumstances only, at the sole discretion of the instructor.

Cheating Policy

Cheating: In this course, “cheating” refers to plagiarism in the written summaries that students submit to the instructor. Cheating in this course is not tolerated. The penalty for cheating in this course is a failing grade for the course.

A summary must consist of a student's sole, original work. Unattributed copying of material from the papers being discussed or other sources is plagiarism as will be treated as such. Unacceptable paraphrasing of papers or other sources is also plagiarism and will be treated as such.
Students are encouraged to discuss the seminar's readings with each other—discussing the papers is a primary activity of this course! However, any written summary that a student submits to the instructor must be the original work of that student alone. Jointly authored summaries are not allowed.

All questions about the definitions of cheating and plagiarism in this course should be directed to the instructor. (The web has many resources that can help you to understand and avoid plagiarism, but if you have questions, please contact the instructor.)

Statement and Acknowledgment: In accordance with the School of Computing's Policy Statement on Academic Misconduct dated January 10, 2012, the instructor will discuss the School's academic misconduct policy in the first two weeks of the course. Students will be required to understand the policy and to submit an acknowledgment form. Links to the policy statement and acknowledgment form are found below.
