# The Classes That We Teach #

Michael and the LN group's doctoral students teach courses at
the University of Utah centered on ideas around interactive narrative,
AI in games and the engineering side of game development.

## For Spring 2017 ##

+ CS 6964, [Computational Models of Interactive Narrative](/_pages/courses/cmin/).  This course
  covers recent research around AI and interactive narrative.  The
  course covers some background on relevant ideas from cognitive
  psychology, narrative theory and cinematography, then focuses on
  applications of AI knowledge representation and reasoning to the
  generation of narrative.

## Other Courses Typically Taught in the Fall Semester

+ EAE 6900, [Game AI](/_pages/courses/gameai/).  This course covers
  current methods for the algorithmic creation of NPC behavior in computer games.
+ EAE 6120,
  [Game Projects 2](http://catalog.utah.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=9&ent_oid=1056#).
  This class is the second course in the EAE masters-level studio sequence,
  and covers the continued development of team-oriented student game
  projects.
