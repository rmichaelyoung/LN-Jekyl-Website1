# The Classes That We Teach #

Michael and the LN group's doctoral students teach courses at
the University of Utah centered on ideas around interactive narrative,
AI in games and the engineering side of game development.

## For Fall 2017 ##

+ EAE 6900, [Game AI](/_pages/courses/gameai/).  This course covers 
  current methods for the algorithmic creation of NPC behavior and 
  other primarily interactive, real-time AI in computer games.

+ CS xxxx,
  [Computational Narrative Seminar](/_pages/courses/cnseminar/).  This
  is a seminar course that focuses on differing topics in
  computational narrative each semeseter.  In the Fall 2017 semester,
  we'll be reading classic and new research on computational modeling
  of character beliefs, desires and intentions in plot.  We'll be
  giving a deep analysis of the Battle of Scarif from _Rogue One: A
  Star Wars Story_ using the computational tools we're reading and developing.


## Other Courses Typically Taught in the Fall Semester

+ EAE 6120,
  [Game Projects 2](http://catalog.utah.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=9&ent_oid=1056#).
  This class is the second course in the EAE masters-level studio sequence,
  and covers the continued development of team-oriented student game
  projects.

## Other Courses Typically Taught in the Spring Semester ##

+ CS 6964, [Computational Models of Interactive Narrative](/_pages/courses/cmin/).  This course 
  covers recent research around AI and interactive narrative.  The 
  course covers some background on relevant ideas from cognitive 
  psychology, narrative theory and cinematography, then focuses on 
  applications of AI knowledge representation and reasoning to the 
  generation of narrative.
