# The Liquid Narrative Group #

The Liquid Narrative research group — housed in both North Carolina
State University’s Computer Science Department and in the School of
Computing at the University of Utah — works in the area of procedural
content generation — the creation of content for interactive games and
other virtual environments — that uses models of narrative to build
stories and tell them automatically. Our work uses techniques from
Artificial Intelligence, Computer Game Design and Development,
Narrative Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Psychology,
Cinematography and other fields to model narrative aspects of human
interaction with computer systems. Our investigation is motivated by
fundamental ideas from narrative theory and looks to provide
computational models of interaction useful across a wide range of
applications including:

+ education & training
+ entertainment
+ visualization
+ computer-mediated communication
+ collaboration and social interaction
