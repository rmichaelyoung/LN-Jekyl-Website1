immigration, with the federal government taking significant new
actions to regulate who can come in to the country.  Students that are considering working with me in the context of the Liquid Narrative
group might be interested to understand how our research agenda is
connected to and impacted by international scholarship.  The science
that I do in my group has historically depended &lt;em&gt;critically&lt;/em&gt; on work
advanced by graduate students from other countries who work with me as
supervisor on their Ph.D. dissertations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My group’s engagement with scientists from other countries isn’t
unique.  It’s the norm in every scientific field and is reflected in
every lab I know here in the US.  Advances in science move forward at
the rate they do in part because the intellectual challenges afforded
by scientific problems are accessible in equal degree to people from
every country.  There’s no national distinction made in the run-time
complexity of an algorithm.  Or in the expressive requirements of a
computational model.  Computer science is beautifully hard in a way
that makes the discovery of algorithms agnostic when it comes to
country of origin.  We’re amazingly fortuate that things work this
way.  If US scientists were the only ones able to work on a class of
problems, advances there would slow to a fraction of their potential
pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current students are enrolled both at the University of Utah and at
NC State University, so the environments at both of these places have
particular import for the way that I can design my research program.
I’m proud of the quick and public responses to questions around
international access to US universities made by both
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/support-for-international-community/&quot;&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://leadership.ncsu.edu/about/chancellor/letters/response-to-immigration-executive-order/&quot;&gt;NCSU&lt;/a&gt;).
Their clear statements about the value of their respective
institutions’ students, staff and faculty who come from outside the US
comes out of a clear understanding of the missions they support, and
of the role of all people in expanding our knowledge of the world we
live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking past broad instituional statements, though, I’m prouder still
of the remarkable international colleagues I’ve been so lucky to have
worked with.  In my lab at NC State, two international doctoral
students, Adam Amos-Binks and Markus Eger, are making significant
advances in knowledge representation and reasoning around plan-based
story structure.  Together, they’ve already published 9 peer-reviewed
papers (the peer-review process for evaluation of research results is
the gold standard of scientific review in computing and other
sciences). Beyond my current team, almost half of the men and women
who have obtained Ph.D.s from my group came to work with me from
outside the United States.  Professors Wei Zhang, Arnav Jhala,
Yun-Gyung Cheong, Byung-Chull Bae and Julio Bahamon all did
groundbreaking research for their dissertations.  Their work has been
published in the top journals in their field and widely cited by our
research community.  Together, these scholars have published more than
185 peer-reviewed scientific papers and their work has been cited by
other scientists’ research over 1,650 times.  Without exception, these
scientists have all gone on to hold positions in outstanding academic
institutions both in the US and in their home countries.  Dr. Camille
Barot, who worked for two years in my lab as a research
scientist, published four papers on breakthrough work that she
directed, adding to the seven that she published as a graduate student
at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be more proud of the advances to science that these friends
of mine have made and continue to make, both through their research
results and through the growing number of new scientists that they
train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like scientists everywhere, the LN group functions &lt;em&gt;by design&lt;/em&gt; within
a global community of scholars.  In that community, we are committed
to openness and inclusivity as essential elements of progress.  I
train my graduate students to work with these same values.  They
graduate from my lab with a charge to apply these values by
illuminating them in their classes, making them the framing for the
research they do on their own and with collaborators, and advancing
them to others with such clarity that they can’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>R. Michael Young, Ph.D.</name><email>young@cs.utah.edu</email></author><summary type="html">Currently in the US, there are ongoing and urgent discussions around

here in the School of Computing about static website generators.  First I’d heard about them.  But the idea was immediately &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their security sounded attractive, because I’d had my academic websites
hacked repeatedly when using other CMSs.  I looked around at the tool
people seemed to like, &lt;em&gt;Jekyll&lt;/em&gt;, and saw that it has some nice
templates (like, for instance, &lt;em&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/em&gt;).  So I started
working on building my Utah website using those tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is February 1, 2017.  I just succeeded in getting the base site up
and running correctly.  It was a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long and winding road, and
ended up taking maybe 50 hours of work to get right.  Of course, when I started, I knew almost
nothing about Ruby, gems, installers, package managers, Jekyll or
Jekyll templates.  But here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I like the way it works and the way it looks.  I’m
almost entirely happy with the site design.  I kinda would prefer some drop down menus that
were triggered by roll-over on the main menu bar at the top of each page.  But that kind of functionality would require a dive
into the template language and modifying the off-the-shelf template I downloaded.  Probably not going to tackle that unless I can find a good tutorial to do just what I want.
The one other thing that I &lt;em&gt;used to really want to change&lt;/em&gt; was the way the list of our publications get live links to the actual PDFs.  I use something called Jekyll Scholar to  auto-generate
the list of pubs from a
.bib file, but when I got it working, the HTML it made for me didn’t contain links to the actual pdfs.  That bugged me enough after I got the site up that
I ended up learning the needed Liquid constructs so that I could hack around on the Jekyll Scholar template to get it to
correctly read and then stuff in the URL as a link in the resulting output HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and integration with Google Analytics was super-easy.  Just two lines of simple edits in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I’m entirely happy with it (modulo the drop-down menus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are affiliated issues.  I keep my source content for
the site on a laptop, and the actual site is served from a virtual
machine.  So every time I write a new blog post or tweak something on
a static page, I manually rebuild and local laptop copy and then sftp
over the site contents to the live server.  That was a pain to do
manually, so I re-familiarized myself with shell scripting and wrote a
script that will handle the re-build locally and the copy and replace
over to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the work I did would be particularly interesting to a computer
scientist or someone who deals with these kind of content creation
processes regularly.  But for me it was totally absorbing.  The best
thing about the process was the flow I experienced while working on
the debugging process for the site.  I miss that in most of my
everyday work, where my day is often broken into hour-long research
discussions about disjoint topics, classes that run an hour or
meetings about administrative topics that run (sometimes painfully)
much too long.  The familiar sense of getting consummed by a technical
process was nostalgic and comforting.  The sense of progress that I felt while
being immersed in the site-building process kept me going when
the more rational of the many voices in my head said to just stop and buy
some off-the-shelf solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have a nice, comfy site that I can build content into here at Utah.  Hopefully I won’t discover that
tutorial on drop-down menus, or my students will start to revolt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>R. Michael Young, Ph.D.</name><email>young@cs.utah.edu</email></author><summary type="html">Back in the Fall of 2016 I read some Slack posts from my new colleages
