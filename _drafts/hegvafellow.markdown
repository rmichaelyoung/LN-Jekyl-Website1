This past Monday night (February CCC, YYYY) i was honored by the board of directors of the HIgher Education Video Game Association with membership in the inaugural class of HEGVA fellows.

The HEGVA fellowship is (as the inaugural stuff implies) brand new.  I had no idea that it was being created, and so when I read Drew Davidson's email inviti9ng me to accept the honor, I was completely surprised.

*What the fellowship means to me*

So.  I've never gotten an award like this, where the idea is that your peers pick you for the honor because of the nature of a long body of work of yours.  I had the I'm not worthy response.  And of course, _I'm not really worthy._  There are dozens if not hundreds of people that deserve this award more than I do.  

*What the fellowship means to us*
