Science of Games.

Herbert Simon's _Sciences of the Artificial_.

Inner environment, outer environment, interface.  Study of invariant properties.

For an artifact like a game, the inner environment is the functioning
of the virtual world at all levels of abstraction/characterization.
The interface is the visual, audio and phsyical interface, including
the keyboard and mouse, etc.  The outer environment is the human user.
The game has goals, and the design task is to design the inner
environment to change to achieve goals embedded in the outer
environment.

the initial configuration is a starting point.  

useful for games.  well, also useful for narrative.

Explain Inner, interface and outer.  Explain how technical views play in to this, like CS relates to AI or Cognitive Science.

Explain that this isn't exclusive of design either.  Just like Simon says that the idea isn't exclusive of borader design.

Explain that this isn't mean to be colonial.  How can this set beside and intergrate with other views of design.  Or other humanist approaches.

Should there be a reference to Horswill's Science Considered Harmful?
