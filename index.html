The Liquid Narrative research group at the University of Utah and NC
State University performs basic and applied research in the area of
procedural content generation that develop new computational models of 
narrative to build stories and tell them automatically. Our work uses
techniques from Artificial Intelligence, Computer Game Design and
Development, Narrative Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive
Psychology, Cinematography and other fields to model narrative aspects
of human interaction with computer systems. Our investigation is
motivated by fundamental ideas from narrative theory and cognitive
psychology, and looks to
provide computational models of narrative-centered interaction useful across a wide range
of applications including:

<ul>
  
  <li>
  virtual worlds/virtual reality
    <li>
  education & training
  <li>
  entertainment
  <li>
  visualization of event data
  <li>
  collaboration and social interaction

</ul>

Any questions not addressed by the project web pages should be addressed to [R. Michael Young](/rmy).
